## Objective

## Language

Use any programming language you are comfortable with.

## Output Requirements:

- For numbers divisible by `3`, output should be **"Fizz"**.
- For numbers divisible by `5`, output should be **"Buzz"**.
- For numbers divisible by both `3` and `5`, output should be **"FizzBuzz"**.
