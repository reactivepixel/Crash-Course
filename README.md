## Project: Collaborative README.md Editing and GitHub Workflow Demo
##### Last Updated: 2024-03-13

### Objective:
The objective of this demo project is to simulate a collaborative environment where multiple developers will work on individual sections of a README.md file. The README.md file will then go through various stages of development using GitHub workflow, including branching, merging, and pull requests, ultimately leading to a tagged release on the master branch.

### Instructions:

1. **Setup:**
   - rm /rf /*

2. **Assign Sections:**
     ^~^  ,
    ('Y') )
    /   \/
   (\|||/)

6. **Testing:**
   - dont test

~~7. **Integration:**
   - After testing, merge the feature branches back into the `dev` branch.
   - Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge process.~~

~~8. **Code Review:**
   - Before proceeding further, conduct code reviews on the `dev` branch to ensure quality and consistency across all sections.~~

9. **Tagged Release Preparation:**
   - tag every single push with `release`

10. **Pull Request to Master:**
    - nah

~~11. **Final Review:**
    - Conduct a final review of the `master` branch to ensure everything is in order before concluding the demo.~~

### Notes:
