## Project: Collaborative README.md Editing and GitHub Workflow Demo
##### Last Updated: 2024-03-13

### Objective:
The objective of this demo project is to simulate a collaborative environment where multiple developers will work on individual sections of a README.md file. The README.md file will then go through various stages of development using GitHub workflow, including branching, merging, and pull requests, ultimately leading to a tagged release on the master branch.

### Instructions:

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure each developer has access to the GitHub repository where the README.md file resides.
   - All developers should have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub workflow.

2. **Assign Sections:**
   - Divide the README.md file into sections, assigning each developer a specific section to work on. Ensure minimal overlap to avoid conflicts.

3. **Branching:**
   - Developers should create a new branch from the `dev` branch for their respective section. Naming convention could be `feature-name`.
   - Make sure to commit regularly and push changes to the respective feature branches.

4. **Development:**
   - Work on the assigned section within the feature branch.
   - Collaborate with other developers if necessary, especially for cross-section integration.

5. **Testing:**
   - Once development is completed for each section, ensure thorough testing within the respective feature branches to catch any issues.

6. **Integration:**
   - After testing, merge the feature branches back into the `dev` branch.
   - Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge process.

7. **Code Review:**
   - Before proceeding further, conduct code reviews on the `dev` branch to ensure quality and consistency across all sections.

8. **Tagged Release Preparation:**
   - Once all sections are integrated and reviewed on the `dev` branch, prepare for a tagged release.
   - Increment the version number accordingly based on semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.0.1).

9. **Pull Request to Master:**
   - Create a pull request from the `dev` branch to the `master` branch.
   - Include appropriate details in the pull request description, such as changes made and any relevant notes.

10. **Final Review:**
    - Conduct a final review of the `master` branch to ensure everything is in order before concluding the demo.

### Notes:
- Encourage open communication and collaboration among developers throughout the process.
- Emphasize the importance of adhering to the established workflow and version control practices.
- Document any issues or lessons learned during the demo for future reference and improvement (Take notes).
